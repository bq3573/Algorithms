# Gift List Command Line Program

## Current Development Stage

Although the project works functionally I am still in the process of implementing the pygments library to make the .py file output to be more stylized.

## Objective

Get experience building Python applications and creating a GUI as well as implementing Python Libraries such as
PyQt5 and pygments.


## Description

This python application allows users to browse through some of my favorite solutions to assignments from an algorithms class.
The user interface for the application is built using tkinter, a Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.
The application presents the solutions in an organized and easy-to-read format, making it a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about algorithm design.
In addition to providing the solutions, the application also includes a brief explanation of the problem and my thought process in arriving at the solution. This project is a great way for me to share my knowledge and experience with others,
and I hope it will be a helpful resource for anyone interested in algorithms and problem-solving.

## Development Environment

Used PyCharm as the IDE and Windows Powershell to execute Git Commands to manage Version Control
